- Implement robust error reporting and logging.

## Documentation

- Document all function parameters and return types clearly.
- Maintain clear documentation for complex trading logic.
- Document all configuration parameters comprehensively.
- Maintain clear API documentation for users and developers alike.
- Document all security considerations thoroughly.

## Best Practices

- Follow ethers.js v6 provider patterns rigorously.
- Utilize appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces effectively.
- Implement dependency injection where applicable for better modularity.
- Employ design patterns that support scalability in your architecture.
- Adhere to a structured git workflow for version control.

Refer to the official Hyperliquid documentation for protocol specifics, as well as the ethers.js v6 documentation for implementation details. Always prioritize security, efficient transaction handling, and adherence to best practices in your development workflow.
